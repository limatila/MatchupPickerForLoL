# How-to-use:
To start the program correctly, execute 'startProgram.bat' or the main program 'main.py', for it to open a console with the program. 

The program is operated by inputting fields, to select options in lane generation, among other functionalities,
The first one will be the Lane in focus to have a Matchup randomized. 
You can choose for Top, Mid, Bot, or Full Team\5v5 for all lanes at once.

The second field will ask how many times should it generate new Matchup names in the Lane selected.
Single Lanes can be randomized in a infinite number, but for Full Team you'll need to select between 1 or 3 times.
If you only want it to generate once, just type '1' and hit enter.

Inputting '0' in any of the fields will result in process closure, it is the method for leaving the application.

Additionally, a way of opening Real Worlds stats will show up in every Matchup, before continuing.
Type 'Y'/'N' (or 'Yes'/'No') to choose if you wan't to open the stats in your browser.
If 'Yes', you need to input your browser of choice to be opened. Just type the shortened browser name("chrome", "opera", "firefox"), and it will open automatically in 2 seconds.
- The selected browser will be the default for the rest of the program's execution.

If you desire to clean the console, if you find it messy, hit 'clear' in Lane selection! It will automatically cleanup your window for the next guess.
